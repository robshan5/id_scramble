Robert,

Attached is a typical historical grade file.  This is from a very old,
retired module, hence only three digits in the module code instead of
today's four.

In theory you would only be interested in the 7 (or now 8)-digit ID and
the grade.  Grades were different back then, too.  Some  things change
:-).

Also, can you have a think about a next step for your correlation
project, namely drawing the correlogram?

Robert,

Just to say, although  all of the data I've sent to you is very old I'd
still ask that you treat it as very confidential.

Also, in preparation for this project I want to give to the LM174
student could I ask you to write an ID scrambler, in python or julia.
Reading a file previously below, could you replace each student ID by an
ID that has had, say, 2 added to each digit, mod 10?  Call the script
scramble-id.{jl,py} and expect the input to come from stdin, the
keyboard.  This way if I ask the student to create a scatter plot of LC
points vs grade awarded they won't be using authentic data.  Make sense?

Míle buíochas,
Paddy
